## Nuxt / Three.js Basic Template 

- [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction).
- [Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/).

This template is a foundational starting point for creative development. It leverages canvas fixed positioning and scroll-jacking to provide a unique web experience. Ideal for developers looking to create immersive and interactive web applications.

## Disclaimer

This template combines Three.js classes with global state management via Nuxt's useState. This approach makes it easier to share state across different components in my opinion, feel free to use another approach.
